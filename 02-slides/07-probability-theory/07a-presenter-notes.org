This video provides an informal overview over basic concepts of probability theory from a subjectivist point of view.

Suppose that we are interested in the weather tomorrow at noon.
For simplicity, we are going to assume that there are only three different states of the weather:
It's sunny, misty or cloudy or rainy.

CLICK

And here is Jones who does not know what the weather will be like, but may have beliefs about how likely it is that it's going to be sunny, cloudy or rainy.
Essentially, what we would like to be able to do is give a *numeric measure* of Jones' *subjective level of confidence* that each particular weather state might obtain.
So, what numbers x, y and z should be use?
It's hard to say.
What's possible to say is that there should definitely be a maximum and a minimum.
If Jones could maximally convinced that it is going to be sunny, and no other option is possible, for instance.
She could also be maximally convinced that it's not going to be sunny, ruling out this possibility completely.

Traditionally, we set the minimum to 0 and the maximum to 1, but really any other (non-negative) pair of numbers would work.
We use a subjective probability of 0 for states or events that an agent completely rules out.
And we use a subjective probability of 1 for states of events that an agent is absolutely certain of.
In sum, probabilities are numbers in the unit interval from 0 to 1.

CLICK

For example, we might model Jones beliefs with the numbers 0.6, 0.2, 0.2 for the (subjective) probability of the weather being sunny, cloudy or rainy.
Another agent, might have different beliefs.
Both agents may be rational, but based on different information or different personal histories, assign different probabilities to the states of the weather.
But what do these numbers mean exactly?

CLICK

One way of making sense of these numbers is in terms of a wheel-of-fortune.
The subjective levels of credence that Jones assigns to the different weather states, (0.6, 0.2, and 0.2), corresponds to the objective chance of turning a wheel-of-fortune like shown here, where the relative proportions of areas corresponds to the proportions of the subjective probabilities.
Notice that this comparison with wheels-of-fortune highlights that, as far as subjective probabilities are concerned, what really matters are relative degrees: how much more likely, i.e, by which factor more likely, is one state of affairs than another.
For example, in Jones' belief state, sunny weather is deemed to be three times as likely as rainy weather.
Correspondingly, the area for the outcome 'sunny' is three times larger than the area for the outcome 'rainy', no matter how large these areas are in absolute terms.

To formally define probability distributions, we would first consider the *set of elementary outcomes* and call it capital *Omega*.
An *event* is any subset of *Omega*.
Think of an event as any potential piece of information or observation regarding which elementary outcome might be true.
A probability distribution assigns a probability (between 0 and 1) to all events, so all subsets of Omega.
The probability assigned to a singleton event, like the even that it is sunny, is the probability we looked at previously: the probability assigned to that elementary outcome.
A non-singleton set, like the set containing 'cloudy' and 'rainy', is interpreted as a disjunction, that it is either cloudy or rainy.
The probability of such an event is given by the sum of the probabilities of the elementary outcomes in it.
For example, ... if cloudy = 0.2 and rainy = 0.2, the probability assigned to the idea that it is either rainy OR cloudy should be 0.4.

While it may be okay to assume that beliefs about the weather are variable between different individuals, there are also cases where normative considerations apply regarding what a rational agent *should* belief.
Take this urn, with 10 balls out of which 2 are black.
The objective probability of drawing blindly from the urn and receiving a black ball is 0.2.
This is related to the limiting frequency with which this event would take place if we repeatedly drew a single ball from the urn (and put it back for the next draw).

CLICK

We can also consider more complex scenarios in which agents may have probabilistic beliefs.
Here is a flip-and-draw scenario.
First we flip a coin, which is assumed to be fair and so lands heads with 0.5 probability.
Depending on whether we see heads or tails we draw from one urn or another.
Elementary outcomes of this process are all combinations of flips and draws.
The probability of each elementary outcome is given by the *path probability*, i.e., the product of each event that led us down this path.

CLICK

Here is tabular view of the path probabilities from the flip-and-draw scenario, together with an example of *conditional probability*.
Concretely, we define the probability of the event that the coin landed heads *given* that we have seen the draw of a black ball from the urn, in terms of the joint probability of "black" and "tails" and the probability of "black", which in this case amounts to 2/3.
The intuition here is that, if we restrict attention to all events where a black ball has been drawn, we are in the left column of the table. The remaining probabilities favor "tails" over "heads" by a factor of 2.
So the probability of "tails" given "black" is 2/3.
