In this video, we are going to go a bit deeper into the basics of naive set theory by learning about relations between and operations on sets.

CLICK

In particular, we look at the subset and superset relation and about various operations on sets, such as power sets and the most basic logical operations on sets, namely intersection, union, difference and complement.

CLICK

Let us start with the subset relation.
By definition, a set X is called a _subset_ of Y if, intuitively speaking, the set X is _completely contained_ in Y.
More formally put, we say that X is a subset of Y if all elements of X are also contained in Y.
We use a special notation for saying that X is a subset of Y, or that it is not, as shown here on the slide.

CLICK

Here is a first example.
We use the universe of toys from the previous lesson.
We know consider a set capital A, marked here in red, consisting of the two game controllers, elements 'a' and 'b', and the set capital B, consisting of all elements 'a' to 'g', marked here in green.
As all elements of set A are also contained in set B, A is a subset of B, which we can write as shown on the slide.

CLICK

For a second example, consider a third set C, here shown in orange.
Is C a subset of B?
No, it is not, because there is at least one element, namely element 'h', which is in set C but not in set B.

CLICK

Now, let's look at a related notion, a so-called _proper subset_.
Set X is a _proper subset_ of Y, if it is a subset of Y, but not identical to Y.
In other words, X is a _proper subset_ of Y, if all elements of X are also in Y, but there is at least one element in Y which is not in X.
Again, we have special formal notation for indicating the relation of "proper subsethood" or its absence.

CLICK

Consider the same sets A and B as before.
Not only is A a subset of B, it is actually a proper subset of B.
This example demonstrates that being a _proper subset_ is a more specific relation than being just a subset.

CLICK

To make this even clearer, consider another example, which may almost seem trivial.
The set B is a subset of itself, but it is NOT a proper subset of itself.
All elements in B are also in B, so B is a subset of B, but there is no element in B which is not also in B.
(In fact, this reasoning is so general that it does not depend on the specific set B here; something we will be talking about in a future lesson, namely so-called proofs.)

CLICK

But for the moment, let us round off the discussion of relations between sets by looking at the concept of a superset.
In abstract terms, supersethood is just the inverse relation of subsethood.
More concretely, Y is a superset of X, just in case X is a subset of Y.
There is special notation of supersethood, which just reverse the sign for subsethood.
The notion of a proper superset is analogously defined.

CLICK

Let us now have a look at operations on sets.
Generally speaking, an operation on sets takes one or several sets as input and outputs another set.
A first prominent and widely used example, is the power set operation.
For any set X, the power set of X is the set of all subsets of X.
We use a special notation, calligraphic P, for the operator that generates the power set of X.
For example, for a set X containing elements 'a' and 'b', the power set has four elements (it has cardinality four), consisting of the empty set (which is a subset of every set), the singleton set containing only 'a', the singleton set containing only 'b' and the set X itself (which is also a subset of itself).

CLICK

Other commonly used operations on sets are those that closely correspond to logical operators 'and', 'or', 'not'.
_Set intersection_ of X and Y is the set of all elements that are in X _and_ in Y.
_Set union_ of X and Y is the set of all elements that are in X _or_ in Y.
The _set difference_ of X 'minus' Y is the set of all elements that are in X but not in Y.
Finally, when there is an explicit or implicit universe, we can define the _complement_ of set X as all elements in the universe which are not in X.

CLICK

Here is an example of set intersection.
The intersection of sets B and C is the set of all elements which occur in both sets.
As set B is a _proper subset_ of set C, this is actually just the set B.
The one element which is in C but not in B, element 'h', is not part of the intersection.

CLICK

In contrast, the union of sets B and C, contains all elements that are found in either set.
Since the set B is a _proper subset_ of set C, this is actually just the set C itself.

CLICK

The set difference "C minus B" is the set of all elements in C which are not in B.
Clearly, this here is the singleton set containing only element 'h'.
The set difference "B minus C" is in fact empty, because there is no element in B which is not also in C, given that B is a subset of C.

CLICK

Finally, the complement of B are all elements in the universe that are not in B.
So, this would be the set containing elements 'h', 'i' and 'j'.
Accordingly, the complement set of C contains only 'i' and 'j'.
