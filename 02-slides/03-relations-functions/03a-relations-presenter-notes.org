In this video, we are going to look at relations.

CLICK

Concretely, we will be looking at the following notions:
tuples, Cartesian products, relations and some common properties of relations.
As usual, we will also get acquainted with the conventional mathematical notation surrounding relations.

Since relations are basically sets of tuples, we will start by looking at the concept of a tuple.
For a set, the only thing that matters is whether an element is inside it or not.
Sets are agnostic to the order in which elements may be arranged, and they do not allow for multiple occurrences of the same element.
In contrast, tuples are more specific.
Think about tuples as order-sensitive collections, where multiple occurrences of elements make a difference.

A tuple with $n$ elements (arranged in order) is also called an $n$-tuple.
It is a common convention to identify a 1-tuple, so to speak, with the single element it contains.
There are special words for $n$-tuples with a small number of elements, e.g., ordered pair, triple, etc.

If tuples are just order-sensitive collections, the Cartesian product of some sets is, intuitively, the set of ALL tuples that can be formed from these sets (in the relevant order).
Concretely, let's first consider the Cartesian product of just two sets X and Y.
The Cartesian product of two sets X and Y is the set of all pairs (or: 2-tuples) such that the first element comes from set X and the second element comes from set Y.

More generally, the Cartesian product of an ordered list of $n$ sets is the set of $n$-tuples such that each element comes from the right set, thus respecting the order in which elements should come from a set.

For example, consider sets X and Y ...

Okay, so far we had tuples (ordered lists of elements) and Cartesian products (sets of all possible tuples from an ordered list of sets).
A relation is just a subset (not necessarily proper) from some Cartesian product.
Let's directly consider an example.
Take a set P of people - John, Mary and Sue.
The Cartesian product $P \times P$ is the set of all tuples formed by taking the first and second element from set $P$.
The relation L, defined here, is just a subset of that Cartesian product.
Think of it in this way.
Our world only has three individuals.
The relation L encodes "who loves whom".
The set of all possible love relationships is the Cartesian product.
Any subset of that Cartesian product is something like a "possible world", a way in which love relations might actually be.
Indeed, everybody could love everybody, or nobody could love anybody, or anything in between.
The actual world might, for example, look like this: ...
We can also represent this in a diagram where ...

Having defined what a relation is, let's look at some more specific terminology and notation.
A relation between two sets is called a binary relation.
For a binary relation, we can use special notation to express the idea that a pair belongs to it.
...
Also, sometimes it may be useful to refer to the domain and range of a binary relation.
The domain is ...
The range is ...

Binary relations have a number of interesting properties for which there are special names.

Finally, when a binary relation has a certain /combination/ of properties, we might give it a special name altogether.
For example, ...
