In this video, we are going to look at examples of different kinds of proof strategies.

The proof strategies we will be looking at are: ...

Let us start, then, with an example of a proof via refutation by counterexample.
This strategy is applicable in cases where a so-called universal statement, e.g., statements that ALL members of some sort have a particular property.
The strategy is to simply find an easy and illustrating counterexample, i.e., a single member of the relevant sort which does NOT have the property in question.

Take the claim that for any sets X and Y ...
This is a claim about, well, any sets.
If we can find a single pair of sets for which the relevant property does NOT hold, we have proved the general claim to be false.

CLICK

There are infinitely many counterexamples for this particular case.
Here is a relatively simple pair of X and Y that suffices to prove the claim false.
X is the set ...
Y is the set ...
...

Let us now look at a different proof strategy: direct proofs.
Suppose we want to prove the following general claim: ...

A direct proof proceeds by making just generally accepted facts, definitions and drawing conclusions about what follows from them in order to arrive at the statement to be proven.

CLICK

To illustrate, we first assume that there is an arbitrary set X.
We do not assume much about X, just that it is a set.
Next, we just remind ourselves (and our imagine audience) of the definition of "subsethood", namely that ...
We then just rephrase that definition by saying that: ...
We now apply this specifically to the case at hand, namely the empty set, by noting that ...

CLICK

to contrast the previous DIRECT proof, let's look at the same example proposition but try to give an INDIRECT proof for it.

An indirect proof, unlike a direct one, assumes that what needs to be proven is false, and then derives a logical contradiction from this assumption by using nothing else than definitions and standard inference rules.

CLICK

For example, let's assume the logical opposite of the claim we want to proof.
Then, by definition of subsethood, we can derive that ...
But then we realize that this is in contradiction of the definition of an empty set.
We have therefore derived a contradiction from the set of relevant definitions and the assumption that the claim to be shown was false.
If the set of definitions is sound (i.e., itself contradiction-free, which we should assume and hope), this means that the claim to be shown must be true.

Finally consider an example of an inductive proof.
Inductive proofs work well in concert with recursively defined concepts.
We therefore consider the example of a very simple set of symbols, called F here, which consists of ...

CLICK

The proposition to be shown is that ...

CLICK

An inductive proof has three parts.
We start the argument at the recursive anchor or  the "atomic elements", so to speak.
Here we would say that ...

CLICK

Next, we will make a large jump and make an assumption that many more complex elements already have the property to be shown.
Concretely, ...

CLICK

The main work then happens in the inductive step, the last part of the proof.
We use the inductive assumption to derive that the next elements not yet covered by the IA also have the property in question.
For example, in the case at hand ...
